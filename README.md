# Zlatan Ibrahimovic Stats Web Scraper

Zlatan Ibrahimovic is a retired Swedish professional soccer player. In this project, I used web scraping techniques to collect his career stats, pulling data from [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/players/4cde5509/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic#all_stats_standard), a popular resource for soccer statistics.

The scraper extracts various performance metrics such as goals, assists, appearances, and more, from different competitions throughout his career.

The data is stored in a structured format, making it ready for further analysis ro visualization
